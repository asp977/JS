	//Reference Type (it is object  datatypes)
		// Array,object litrals,function ,dates ,set,map,etc...
		    //--> heap means dynamic memory location
		    //--> Memory location in heap
		    //--> heap is part of the RAM Memory ,heap means dynamic memory location

    // both arr1 and arr2 has same pointer (means their address)  in stack  and address pointer to their  value stroe in heap that's the  reason it will give same output.

    //working
    //1. if  arr1 execute  then arr1 create pointer(address) in stack  and also address pointer to their store value in heap 

    //2. after that arr2 will create new pointer above the  arr1 in stack 
    //3.in stack both arr1 and arr2 has same address 

    //4.Now for printing arr1 and arr2 , first  arr1 point to the address of the heap and  print the value stroe in that address and arr2 also print  with thier arr2  address.

   //5.After pushing the element in arr1 address.now arr1 has 3 elements

   //6. According to print  statement  arr1 and arr2  executed 
  // both updated arr1 and arr2 has same pointer (means their address)  in stack  and address pointer to their  value stroe in heap that's the  reason it will give same output.
